Good afternoon. My name is Madhu. I am a Java backend developer with over three years of experience, currently working at Infovision in the steel manufacturing domain.

In my current project for JSW Steel, we are building the platform from scratch using modern tools such as Redis, Apache Kafka, and Spring Batch. 
I have contributed to various modules, and independently developed the reporting services using JasperStudio. 
This involved creating dynamic and static reports, dashboards, charts, and a SQL lab for data analysis.

I have also worked on several POCs, including Redis, MapStruct, and Spring Batch, which led to significant improvements and were successfully implemented in our ongoing projects. 
Additionally, I contributed to an MDM project under the guidance of our enterprise architect.

Recently, our team has been exploring AI tools and plugins to enhance our development process, and I have been actively involved in completing related POCs. 
To broaden my skill set and become a full-stack developer, I am currently learning frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and React.

I am excited about opportunities where I can leverage my backend expertise, contribute to innovative projects, and continue to grow as a full-stack developer.
