Good evening.
My name is Madhu, and I’m from Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from G. Pulla Reddy Engineering College in 2020.

Coming to my professional career:
 
I started my professional career with an internship at Pratian Technologies from January to May 2022.
Post that, I joined Infovision, where I’ve been working as a Java Backend Developer for over three years, primarily in the steel manufacturing domain.
Currently, I’m part of a project for JSW Steel, where we're building a platform from scratch using modern technologies like Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, Spring Batch, and Redis.

I have contributed to various modules, and independently developed a reporting microservice using JasperReports and JasperStudio. 
It supports static reports, dashboards, charts, and an SQL lab for querying data.
And enhanced the framework with dynamic custom reports (as per customer requirements) which can connect to mutliple data sources with data integrity. 

Additionally, I contributed to an MDM project under the guidance of our enterprise architect.  This is a Low Code No Code MDM, devided into phases, i was part of the phase-1, 
where I developed dynamic REST APIs that support CRUD operations for any entity without writing repetitive code.

I have also worked on several POCs, including Redis, MapStruct, and Spring Batch, which led to significant improvements and were successfully implemented in our ongoing projects.

Recently, our team has been exploring AI tools and plugins to enhance our development process, and I have been actively involved in it. 
As part of exploration, evaulted couple of tools like perplexity, jhipster , intellj with junie,

To broaden my skill set and become a full-stack developer, I am currently learning frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and React.

I am excited about opportunities where I can leverage my backend expertise, contribute to innovative projects, and continue to grow as a full-stack developer.
