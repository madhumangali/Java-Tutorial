what is SQL ?
sql is known as structured query language.
sql is standard programming lanuage which is used to manage & manipulate the relational databases.

what is primary key, unique key and foriegn key and there differences ?

A primary key is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table
=> must be unique
=> can't be null
=> each table contains only one primary key

A unique key also ensures that all value int he column are unique, but allows one null (in most databse like MYSQl)
=> must be unique
=> can contain null
=> A table can have multiple unique keys

A Foreign key is used to create a relationship b/w two tables, it references the primary key of another table>
  => enforces referntail integrity
  => can contain null values (if Optinal)
  => can have duplicate values.
  => can't insert a value unless it exits in the referenced table.

Feature	                          Primary Key	          Unique Key	         Foreign Key
Uniqueness	                      ‚úÖ Must be unique 	‚úÖ Must be unique	     ‚ùå Can be duplicate
NULL Allowed	                    ‚ùå Not allowed	    ‚úÖ One NULL (MySQL)	  ‚úÖ Allowed (optional ref)
Count per table	                  1 only	            Many allowed	          Many allowed
Purpose	                          Identity	          Prevent duplicates	    Link tables
Used to reference another table?	‚ùå No	              ‚ùå No	                ‚úÖ Yes (references PK/UK)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what are constraints in SQL ?

Constaints are rules that are applied to the columns/tables to enforce data integrity, accuracy and consistency.

Here‚Äôs a list of the most common constraints:

Constraint	                Description
PRIMARY KEY	        Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
FOREIGN KEY	        Ensures referential integrity between tables.
UNIQUE	            Ensures all values in a column are different.
NOT NULL	          Prevents NULL values from being inserted.
CHECK	              Ensures values meet a specific condition.
DEFAULT	            Provides a default value for a column.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Query to retrieve all records from a table ?
select * from employees;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
difference b/w  DELETE and truncate?

Feature	                         DELETE	                            TRUNCATE
Used for	                 Removing specific rows or all rows	   Removing all rows from a table
Can filter rows?	         ‚úÖ Yes, using WHERE	                 ‚ùå No ‚Äì removes all rows
Rollback (Undo)?	         ‚úÖ Yes (if inside a transaction)	   ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends (usually not rollbackable)
Speed	                     Slower (row-by-row)	                 Faster (bulk operation)
Resets Auto Increment?	   ‚ùå No	                               ‚úÖ Yes (in many DBMS)
Triggers fire?	           ‚úÖ Yes	                                 ‚ùå No
Locks                    	 Row-level locks	                      Table-level lock

DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
find max salary from employees table?
select max(salary) from employees;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Query to fetch the second highest salary
select max(salary) from employee where salary < ( select max(salary) from employee ) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is join and explain it types?

A JOIN is used to retrieve data from multiple tables where there is a logical relationship between them.

Type of                      JOIN	Description
INNER JOIN	        Returns only matching rows in both tables
LEFT JOIN	          Returns all rows from the left table + matched rows from the right
RIGHT JOIN	        Returns all rows from the right table + matched rows from the left
FULL JOIN	          Returns rows when there is a match in either left or right
SELF JOIN         	A table joined with itself
CROSS JOIN	        Returns the Cartesian product (all combinations)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Query to fecth employee name and dept name using join

select e.employee_name, dept.dept_name form employee as e
join department as dept on dept.dept_id = e.dept_id
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
explain Groupby clause?

The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like:
total salary per department
count of orders per customer
average score per student

=> Every column in SELECT that is not aggregated must be in the GROUP BY.
=> Use HAVING to filter groups (not WHERE).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Query to count employees in each dept?

select count(*), dept_id from employees group by dept_id;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
difference b/w having and where

Feature                  	WHERE	                    HAVING
Used for	           Filtering rows	              Filtering groups (after GROUP BY)
Works with	         Raw data (before grouping)	   Aggregate data (like SUM, AVG)
When it runs	       Before grouping	              After grouping
Can use aggregates?	    ‚ùå No	                     ‚úÖ Yes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
query to fetch the departments with more than 5 employees?

select dept_id,count(*) from employees group by dept_id having count(*) > 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNION vs UNION ALL

UNION and UNION ALL are both used to combine results from two or more SELECT statements in SQL ‚Äî but there's a key difference in how they handle duplicates.

Feature	                  UNION	                                       UNION ALL
Duplicates	      ‚ùå Removes duplicates	                           ‚úÖ Keeps duplicates
Performance	      üê¢ Slower (needs sorting for duplicates)	      ‚ö° Faster (no duplicate check)
Sorting	          Automatically sorts results (in many DBs)     	No sorting unless you add ORDER BY
Use case	        When you want distinct results	                When you want everything (faster)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is SubQuery?

A subquery (also called an inner query or nested query) is a query written inside another SQL query. It's used to return data that the main query (outer query) will use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
query to fecth all employees whose salary is greater than avg salary

select * form employees where salary > (select avg(salary) from employees)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indexes vs Views in sql?

What is an Index?
An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval.
It‚Äôs like an index in a book ‚Äî helps the database quickly find rows without scanning the entire table.
Created on one or more columns of a table.
Can be unique or non-unique.

What is a View?
A view is a virtual table ‚Äî a stored SELECT query.
It does not store data physically (except materialized views).
Used to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and provide security (restrict columns/rows).
