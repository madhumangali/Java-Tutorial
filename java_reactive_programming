Core Features of Reactive Programming
--------------------------------------
1. New Programming Paradigm
2. Asynchronous and non blocking
3. Functional Style code
4. Data Flow as event driven stream
5. Backpressure on data streams

synchronous and blocking :-
--------------------------

swiggy -> Restaurant -> cook.

Took the customer's order
Told cook for prepare order
Waited for the food to be cooked
Gave it to the customer
After all of that, then took the
next person's order.

Asynchronous and non blocking :-
-------------------------------
Restaurant (Subscriber) -> Cook (Publisher)
1.Take a customer's order
2.Tell the cook to prepare food
3.Instead of waiting for it to be cooked, take the next person's order and listen for (subscribe to) the cook to tell you the first customer's food is done
4.Once the food is done, you give the food to the customer
